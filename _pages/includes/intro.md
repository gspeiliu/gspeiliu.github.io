# 👨🏻‍💻 About Me

Pei Liu is now a Postdoctoral Researcher. He holds a Ph.D. from [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu), where he was supervised by Professor [John Grundy](https://sites.google.com/site/johncgrundy/) and Professor [Li Li](https://lilicoding.github.io/). Prior to that, he obtained his master degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) and Bachelor from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/).
His research focuses on program analysis, mining software repository, and Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering (AI4SE), and Software Engineering for Artificial Intelligence (SE4AI). He combines static and dynamic program analysis techniques with advanced large language models (LLMs) to unveil the evolution of software systems, uncover deployment issues of pre-trained AI models, and detect software defects—such as silently evolved methods in Android OS frameworks and compatibility issues in Android apps-—and identify and analyze embedded AI capabilities in intelligent software artefacts. 
His broader research goal is to enhance the reliability, transparency, and maintainability of modern software systems, especially in the era of rapidly evolving AI technologies.
